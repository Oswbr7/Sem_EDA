Cut off my wings and come lock me up
Just pull the plug yeah, I've had enough
Tear me to pieces, sell me for parts
You're all vampires so here
You can have my heart
You can have my heart
You can have my heart
You can have my heart
The walls are a funeral, I run with ghosts
No hint of movement, no sign of pulse
Only an echo, just skin and bone
Then kick the chair but we, we help tie the rope
You can have my heart
You can have my heart
You can have my heart
So come rain on my parade
'Cause I want to feel it
Come shove me over the edge
'Cause my head is in overdrive
I'm sorry but it's too late
And it's not worth saving
So come rain on my parade
I think we're doomed
I think we're doomed
And there is no way back
You must of made some kind of mistake
I asked for death,â€¦
